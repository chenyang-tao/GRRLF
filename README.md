# Generalized Reduce Rank Latent Factor Regression (GRRLF)



#### This package includes:
* GM-GRRLF Riemannian manifold GRRLF solver (implemented with [Manopt](http://www.manopt.org/)).
* NNR-GRRLF Nuclear norm regularization based GRRLF solver.
* RRR-PCA-GRRLF Simplest RRR-PCA implementation.

For completeness, GRRLF is distributed with [Manopt 2.0.0](http://www.manopt.org/).

#### Current release: v 0.1.0
