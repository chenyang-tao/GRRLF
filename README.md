# Generalized Reduce Rank Latent Factor Regression (GRRLF)

#### This package includes:
* GM-GRRLF General manifold GRRLF solver (implemented with Riemannian manifold optimization).
* NNR-GRRLF Nuclear norm regularization based GRRLF solver.
* RRR-PCA-GRRLF Simplest RRR-PCA implementation.

For completeness, GRRLF is distributed with [Manopt 2.0.0](http://www.manopt.org/).
